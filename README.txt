multiClipBoard.py
**************************

A simple yet useful python script that will save multiple keywords or keyphrases onto the 
clipboard and will load them either individually or as a list. 

Usage:
* To save data onto the mcb script, you'll either need to copy some data onto your clipboard or 
simply enter the data right after calling the script. 
**** For Example: python3 multiClipBoard.py <keyword>/copied text
* To load data from the mcb script, you can either use the keyword associated with the saved block 
of text, or the command "list". 
**** For Example: python3 multiClipBoard.py list OR python3 multiClipBoard.py <keyword>

And that's it! 

Quite simple to use but very handy when working with a lot of data. 

Enjoy!
